{|~`}][N}Good morning, Strawman|WD}You are awake. Again. 

Somebody is loudly talking on their cellphone on the sidewalk outside. 

You feel a little nauseated, a little dehydrated.

You eye the room cautiously. The process of waking up is a little surreal.

If you can just get a little caffeine into your body, maybe this whole process will amount to something.

You are in the bedroom of your apartment. It is a swirling mass of sepia. 
You feel like bedrooms are a 'Las Vegas' situation: 
What happens in the bedroom, stays in the bedroom.|IN}0|LD}It's a pretty standard apartment bedroom. 
The walls are vaguely tan-colored, the carpet is vaguely grey, vaguely brown. It's as if the designer pre-ruined everything to beat the tenants to the punch.|P}1|RE}You are back in the bedroom. 
It's like a microcosm of the circle of life and death; you sleep, you wake up, you sleep, you wake up - and eventually, you become so sick of the whole affair that you stop doing either and fall asleep at the wheel.|SD}the bedroom.|V}0|SL}you see the bedroom.

Which is a thinly-veiled metaphor for life. If you believe in things like that.|IN}0|LD}You are standing in the hallway. 
There is a dark patch on the floor. The shower has been leaking for months. 
You reported it to the landlord, but the report was met with classic apathy.|P}1|RE}You are back in the hallway. The cycle continues.|SD}the hallway.|V}0|SL}you see the hallway. It signifies both momentum and stangation. Divine.|AN}hall`hallway|~N}Bathroom|I}Teaspoon|E}1|ED}You are standing in the bathroom. The shower drips continuously. 
You swear you can make out a faint commandment as the drip hits the floor: "Kill... kill... kill"; but that could just be wishful thinking.|IN}0|LD}The brown-tiled floor is patchy at best. 
The basin has a fine carpet of stubble. 
Familiarity has bred contempt - you hate this room.|P}1|RE}You are standing in the bathroom once again. The shower continues to drip. It's a "telltale heart" style of fiasco.|SD}the bathroom.|V}0|SL}you see the bathroom.

You consider consumption and expulsion to be two sides of the same disgusting coin.|IN}0|LD}The kitchen has a cork floor and a benchtop stained with coffee.

This is the real nerve centre of this whole sick affair.|IN}0|LD}Two naked lightbulbs hum above you. 
You disagree with 'fancy' light fittings, so you removed them all when you moved into the apartment. 
You have a television but you only use it to drown out the sound of the neighbours practicing piano.|P}1|RE}You are back in the living room. Nothing has changed. This is both depressing and comforting.|SD}the living room.|V}0|SL}the living room.|AN}living room`living`lounge|~N}Book Room|I}Bookshelf|E}1|ED}You are in the book room. It has that cool, 'nothing' atmosphere that informs your senses that this room is rarely used.|IN}0|LD}You fight constantly against the urge to call this the 'spare room'. You can't have a spare room in a two bedroom apartment. It tastes needless.|P}0|RE}You are back in the book room.

You have nothing else to report.|AN}book|~{N}Coffee Cup|AN}cup`mug|CT}1|ID}A coffee cup .|IE}The coffee cup is the perfect size. Two full cups of coffee are just enough to kickstart your day but not so much as to tax your heart. You used to use a 'The Godfather' branded cup, but it was too big. You were more coffee than man.|RD}A coffee cup sits atop a pile of books.|RE}The coffee cup precariously sits atop a stack of books. It contains half a centimetre of cold tea. The cup is decorated with bees, and is striped yellow and black. You like bees.|TD}You take the coffee cup and spin it around your finger.

When you left home, you took it with you. 
It stirred your first ever cup of coffee, and you are intent that it will stir your last.|RD}A teaspoon sits on the basin.|RE}There is a teaspoon on the basin. 
This is not a random occurence. 
You walk around with teaspoons, you gesture with them, you perform bold monologues with them. 
They are the skull of Yurik in the Hamlet of your life.|TD}You take the teaspoon, wipe it on your leg and put it in your pocket. With this teaspoon you feel as if you could accomplish anything.|SR}1|~N}Faucet|AN}faucet`tap`water|CT}0|ID}|IE}|RD}The water faucet hangs, predictably, over the basin.|RE}You feel ashamed that you don't know how the faucet works.
You are on the third floor of the apartment block, and water inexplicably reaches this pipe and is at your mercy. 
The world is an amazing place.|TD}|SR}1|~N}Sugar|AN}sugar|CT}0|ID}|IE}|RD}A plastic tub of sugar sits on the bench.|RE}You would describe it as a tupperware tub of sugar, but you suspect that 'tupperware' is actually a brand name.

You didn't buy it. You think that it was somehow given to you when you left home.

It has a vague creamy-colored froth over it. You call this the 'skin'. It has cannibal overtones, and you love it all the more for it.|TD}You take the cup of coffee. It smells delicious.
